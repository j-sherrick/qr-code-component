### Overview

This is a reusable card component that uses node-qrcode bundled with Browserify for client-side generation of QR codes.

## My process

I had only vaguely heard of web components, so my first step was to head on over to the Mozilla docs and have a look at the API reference. I wanted to use component-based design without relying on a framework, keeping things as 'vanilla' as possible. I needed to see someone implement a practical, working example of a component using the Web Component API, and luckily one of [my favorite web dev YouTube channels](https://www.youtube.com/@WebDevSimplified) had a video that was exactly what I needed.

## Built with

- [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components) - Web Component API
- [Browserify](https://browserify.org/) - Dependency bundler
- [node-qrcode](https://www.npmjs.com/package/qrcode/) - QR code generator

## What I learned
- Web Component API
- Shadow DOM
- Dependency bundlers

## Useful resources

- [mdn web docs - Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components) - Documentation on Web Components API
- [Learn Web Components in 25 Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I7uX8m0Ta0) - This is a great video from one of my favorite YouTube channels that shows a practical example of how to build and use a component using the web components API

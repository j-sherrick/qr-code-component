## My process

I had only vaguely heard of web components, so my first step was to head on over to the Mozilla docs and look at the API reference to learn how to even use them in the first place. I understood the general concept but then went over to one of my favorite YouTube channels, [Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/@WebDevSimplified) to watch a video and see a practical working example.

### Built with

- [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components) - Web Component API
- [Browserify](https://browserify.org/) - Dependency bundler

### Useful resources
